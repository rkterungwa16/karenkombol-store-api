Attire Guide: Dress Codes from Casual to White Tie

Casual

Casual dress code refers to clothing that is informal and comfortable, yet clean and professional. It’s best to go with nicer casual wear and avoid the baggier items you wear around the house.

Women
Sundress
Long or short skirt
Khakis or nice jeans
Shorts (depending on occasion and climate)
Plain T-shirt (no slogans), polo shirt, turtleneck
Casual button-down blouse
Men
Khakis or good jeans (clean, no holes)
Cargo or Bermuda shorts—depending on occasion and climate
Plain T-shirt (no slogans), polo shirt, turtleneck
Casual button-down shirt and/or sweater
Loafers, sneakers (with or without socks), sandals



Dressy Casual
A dressy casual dress code is a versatile balance between formal and casual. This is the ideal choice for networking (or socializing) after work, fundraisers, or dinner at a nice restaurant.

Women
Dress
Skirt and dressy top
Dressy pants outfit
Nice jeans and dressy top
Men
Seasonal sport coat or blazer, and slacks
Dress shirt, casual button-down shirt, open-collar or polo shirt
Optional tie


Semi-formal

A semi-formal dress code is best described as being more formal than what you would wear to an office, but slightly less formal than what you would wear to a formal event. Do keep in mind that if the event is later than 6 in the evening, you’ll want to err on the side of formality.

Women
Short afternoon or cocktail dress
A “little black dress”
Long dressy skirt and top
Dressy separates
Men
Dark, business suit
Matching vest (optional)
Dress shirt
Tie
Leather dress shoes and dark dress socks

Business Formal*

A business formal dress code is characterized by a suit jacket with matching pants or a skirt. The darker the suit, the more formal. There are seasonal variations as well as matching accessories to personalize your look, but they should not be a distraction in any way.

Women
Suit
Business-style dress
Dress with a jacket
Stockings (optional in summer)
Heels, low or high
Men
Dark business suit
Matching vest (optional)
Dress shirt
Conservative tie

Business Casual*
Casual business attire is pretty ambiguous, but generally means slacks, khakis, or a skirt with a dress shirt, blouse or polo. Dresses and seasonal sport coats fall into this dress code as well.

Women
Skirt, khakis, or pants
Open-collar shirt, knit shirt or sweater (no spaghetti straps or décolleté)

Dressy cocktail dress
Your dressiest “little black dress”
